# My CTF scripts

## Hello!

This is a (very) little collection of ctf scripts I've made.

They're probably not very useful for everybody, this is just a personal thing I'm working on to help me do CTFs.

If anyone wants to use this though, just run `python ./install.py` and it will copy the scripts from my git repos into the `./ctf-scripts/scripts` folder.

Don't forget to change permissions to allow execution and add the `scripts/` folder to the $PATH variable if you want to be able to execute the script from anywhere (`export PATH=$PATH:~/ctf-scripts/scripts`)
